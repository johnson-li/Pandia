Emulator
===


The emulator is a gym environment named WebRTCEmulatorEnv that runs both WebRTC sender and receiver in a single container. The sender and the receiver communicate via the localhost interface and the network is shapped by tc. The implementation is in [pandia/agent/env_emulator.py](pandia/agent/env_emulator.py).
